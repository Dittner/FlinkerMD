### Paragraph customization
Begin paragraph with a `tilde mark` to highlight a block of text: 
~ The whole paragraph is highlighted.
css:
```code
p.md-tilde {
    color: white;
}
```

Begin paragraph with a `exclamation mark` to urgently report information for warning: 
! Attention! Required reading.
css:
```code
p.md-warn {
    color: #ff6161;
    border: 1px solid #ff6161;
    padding: 20px;
}
p.md-warn::before {
  content: "⚠ ";
  font-size: 1.2rem;
}
```
